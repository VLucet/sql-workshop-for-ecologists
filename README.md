An adaptation of the [Data Carpentry's Data Management with SQL for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) into a slide format with less details, but also with a few extra steps, as the R code equivalent to the SQL code is shown to help participants understand the data manipulation operations.
